# MDB Mini Project 2 - Pokédex
This app allows users to look through a catalog of 800 pokémon. Users can filter by name, number, stats, and type. In case there are too many pokémon, users can ask to see 20 at random. In addition, users can click any pokemon and see a detailed profile from which they can see an online view and add it to their favorites. All favorited pokemon will be shown in the favorites tab.
